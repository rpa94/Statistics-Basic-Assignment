In this method, every individual has the same probability of being selected. The researcher aims to collect data from as large a portion as possible of this randomly chosen subset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the field of statistics, sampling serves as the technique for selecting a portion of the population to draw statistical inferences. This subset's characteristics allow us to estimate the attributes of the entire population. In the realm of market research, sampling methods fall into two primary categories: Random or probability sampling and non-probability sampling.\n",

        "When to Use Random Sampling:\n",

        "* When the population is relatively homogenous: Simple random sampling works well when the population shares similar characteristics, as each individual has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
        "* When the population size is known: If the total population size is known, simple random sampling ensures that every individual has a known and non-zero chance of being included in the sample.\n",
        " * When there is no need for specialized knowledge: Simple random sampling is straightforward to implement and does not require extensive prior information about the population.\n",
        "* When statistical inference is the primary goal: Simple random sampling is often used when researchers need to make generalizations about the population based on the sample data, as it provides an unbiased estimate of population parameters.\n",

        "Students will use data from a random sample to make inferences about a population. A random sample is the subset of the population selected without bias in order to make inferences about the entire population. Random samples are more likely to contain data that can be used to make predictions about a whole population. The size of a sample influences the strength of the inference about the population. For instance, the larger the sample, the stronger the inference about the population and the smaller the sample, the weaker the inference about the population.\n",

        "Ans.Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset. It indicates whether the data points are skewed to the left (negative skew) or the right (positive skew) relative to the mean. Skewness helps understand the underlying distribution of data, which is crucial for decision-making, risk assessment, and predicting future trends.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Visual Inspection: The simplest way to assess skewness is by creating a histogram or a density plot of the given data. If the plot is skewed to the left, it is negatively skewed, and if the plot is skewed to the right, it is positively skewed. If the plot is roughly symmetric, it has no skewness.\n",

It's used in statistics to understand the spread of data by focusing on the central part, ignoring any extreme values or outliers. This makes the IQR a useful tool when you want to get a clear sense of where most of your data points lie, without letting unusually high or low values distort the picture. Essentially, the IQR helps describe how clustered or spread out the middle portion of your data is.\n",
